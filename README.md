# Game Closure test game

## Overview and acknowledgments
This is a test project to showcase the creation process and organization of a HTML5 game using the following tools:

* Phaser 3 as a main framework.
* Typescript 3.8.2
* TSLint as a codestyle checker.
* Webpack as a bundler and module loader.
* Phaser 3, Webpack 4 and Typescript [boilerplate project by Pavle Goloskokovic](https://github.com/pavle-goloskokovic/phaser3-webpack4-typescript-boilerplate). The reasons for using this are:
  * Webpack is the industry standard for building, bundling and handling module loading in frontend applications and in anything that works in the browser in general.
  * Phaser 3 as the latest version has got the latest and best features.
  * Typescript along with TSLint (in the future ESLint TS plugins) allows more structured code and advanced bug avoidance due to typing and other tools.
* Graphic resources from [opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org/)
